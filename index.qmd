I am a conservation ecologist and I joined [Lanzhou
University](https://www.lzu.edu.cn/) in June after my postdoctoral
research at the [ConservationEE lab](https://www.conservationee.org/) in
Peking University.

My research interests focus on:

1\) identifying optimal land-use planning strategy for maximizing
the co-benefits of biodiversity and other essential ecosystem services;

2\) understanding the biodiversity responses to land-use change and the
underlying ecological processes.

I use empirical data, meta-analytical and simulation approaches to
identify opportunities for safeguarding biodiversity and delivering
broader benefits.
