Retention forestry (also known as "[variable
retention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_retention)") has
increasingly been adopted as an effective practice for ecologically
sustainable forest management in order to reconcile demand for timber
with biodiversity conservation. The pivotal object of retention forestry
is, during harvest, to retain undisturbed patches within and adjacent to
harvest units so that these patches can sustain mature forest species
and process at the site-scale. In addition, this retention helps
facilitate the re-establishment of mature forest species into previously
harvested areas. However, the capacity of the developing forest after
disturbance to provide habitat for many mature forest organisms varies
not only with the internal characteristics of the regenerating forest,
but also with the relative amount of mature forest ("[landscape
context](https://fragstats.org/index.php/background/landscape-context)")
in the surrounding landscape.

We set out to quantify the relative importance of landscape, spatial,
and other factors by surveying beetle diversity in regeneration forest
sites from each of 16 classes, representing each 125 m and 10% interval
of forest influence and landscape context, respectively. The age range
of regeneration forest sites was 40--58 years old. Twelve representative
unlogged mature forest sites were selected to be well-distributed among
the regeneration sites as controls.

While the geographic locations of sites accounted for most of composite
ecological gradients, the beetle community is subtly influenced by the
effects of landscape context, forest influence and other variables
relating to landscape configuration. Long-term conservation of local
biodiversity in managed forests requires maintaining a certain amount of
mature forest, but their importance as beetle source populations
declines as the regeneration forests mature.
